Script to prepare additional filters for later usage. 
All filters are summarized in ./filters/filters.json
For non-exisiting filters, the transmission curve is downloaded into ./filters
Filter data is uniquely taken from svo2 webpage (see below)
Their naming convention is followed.

Requires: Change of USER INPUT

  - name of instrument and filter that is required
  - effective wavelength of the filter; unit: Angstrom
