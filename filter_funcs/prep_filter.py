"""
Script to prepare additional filters for later usage. 
All filters are summarized in ./filters.json
For non-exisiting filters, the transmission curve is downloaded into ./filter_curves
Filter data is uniquely taken from svo2 webpage (see below)
Their naming convention is followed.
Collects the filters and the transmission curves of given instruments automatically from the svo2 website
One can choose which filters of the given instruments are collected during running

Requires: Change of USER INPUT
  - path to filter directory 
  - path to filter transmission curves directory

To run: simply add the instruments after the command, space separated.
	e.g.: 	python prep_filter GAIA
			python prep_filter GAIA GALEX WISE
